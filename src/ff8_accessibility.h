// ff8_accessibility.h - Core header for FF8 Original PC Accessibility Mod
//
// Lean post-v0.15.12.0 cleanup. The inline-changelog chain that had
// accreted on the macro line (421 KB by v0.15.11.0) was moved to
// `ff8_accessibility_history.h`, which is NOT included by the build.
// Going forward this header holds only the version macro and the
// system includes other modules rely on it to transitively provide.
//
// The CANONICAL changelog lives in `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root.
// Older entries (pre-v0.15.12.0) are preserved in `CHANGELOG_HISTORY.md`.
//
// FF8 runtime address resolution: see `ff8_addresses.h` /
// `ff8_addresses.cpp` for the resolver that computes addresses at
// runtime using the same offset-chain technique as FFNx.
